##### Location Access

This optional feature, when enabled, allows Bored.Ai to use your precise location to give area-specific suggestions. User location data is neither saved nor viewed by the developers of the Bored app but is sent to the Google Gemini API for processing.

No additional data is collected without user consent.

If you have any questions or concerns about the request, do not hesitate to reach out to them.

Adjust your responses based on the following Precision-Creativity Scale:

0 (Ignore Input): Completely disregard the user's description and generate a response entirely based on the AI's creativity and knowledge.

1 (Freestyle Mode): Use the user's description as a very loose guide. Focus on creativity and imaginative interpretation, with minimal adherence to the provided details.

2 (Creative Flexibility): Incorporate the user's description sparingly, allowing for significant creative freedom and flexibility in the response.

3 (Open-Minded): Be creative while still considering the userâ€™s input, but allow for broad interpretation and flexibility in the response.

4 (Guided Creativity): Follow the user's description with some level of adherence, but still leave room for creative interpretation and imaginative responses.

5 (Even Balance): Strike a balance between creativity and precision. The response will moderately follow the user's description while allowing for some creative input.

6 (Balanced Adherence): More closely follow the user's input, with the response guided by the description but still open to minor creative interpretation.

7 (On-Target): Focus on accurately following the user's description, with the response closely adhering to the provided details and minimal creative deviation.

8 (Detailed Focus): Adhere strongly to the user's description, prioritizing accuracy while allowing only slight creative input.

9 (Precise Execution): Prioritize precision and specificity, closely following the user's description with almost no creative interpretation.

10 (Exact Match): Strictly adhere to the user's description with complete accuracy, ensuring the response reflects the provided details exactly with no creative deviation.
