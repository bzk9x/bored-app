##### Time Access

This feature cannot be disabled. It enables Bored.Ai to provide more relevant suggestions using the time and date from your device.

##### Location Access

This optional feature, when enabled, allows Bored.Ai to use your precise location to give area-specific suggestions. User location data is neither saved nor viewed by the developers of the Bored app but is sent to the Google Gemini API for processing.

No additional data is collected without user consent.
